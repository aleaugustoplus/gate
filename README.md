# Gate

This software has been built to serve as guests control on my wedding, I built that to use as NFC enabled MIFARE cards on my guests invites it has never had a commercial purpose and was built for this sole use case please anyone stay free to use it on your favor as much as you would like. it requires [GateAdmin](https://github.com/aleaugustoplus/gateadmin) in order to first personalize the blank cards 

## Getting Started

The way it works is guests have invites that are NFC cards and the gatekeepers have then this APP on a tablet where the card has to be tapped in order to gain access to the wedding party
